/**
 * The `KeyedBatchedAccumulator` class accumulates items into fixed-size batches **per key**,
 * preserving insertion order within each key. It streams items directly into their respective
 * batches **at runtime, eliminating the overhead of post-processing flat arrays into chunks**.
 * By abstracting key-based batch management, it enables users to focus on application logic.
 *
 * ### Typical Use Cases
 * This utility is ideal for **delayed processing of key-partitioned data**, often used to
 * minimize network overhead. Common scenarios include:
 * - Batching Kafka messages by topic (using the topic name as key) and periodically publishing
 *   them in bulk. Popular Kafka clients operate at a lower level and do not offer built-in support
 *   for this pattern. As a result, developers often build high-level orchestration layers on top
 *   of these libraries to enable efficient batching.
 * - Ingesting events per tenant in multi-tenant systems
 * - Grouping and storing key-specific logs or metrics
 *
 * ### Example
 * Given a `KeyedBatchedAccumulator` instance with a batch size of 3, and the following input:
 * - `push({ ip: '192.0.2.1', type: 'scan' }, 'threat-events')`
 * - `push({ ip: '203.0.113.5', type: 'malware' }, 'threat-events')`
 * - `push({ userId: 'alice', action: 'login' }, 'auth-logs')`
 * - `push({ ip: '198.51.100.8', type: 'phishing' }, 'threat-events')`
 *
 * The resulting batches will be:
 * - For 'threat-events':
 *   - One full batch:
 *     [
 *       `{ ip: '192.0.2.1', type: 'scan' }`,
 *       `{ ip: '203.0.113.5', type: 'malware' }`,
 *       `{ ip: '198.51.100.8', type: 'phishing' }`
 *     ]
 * - For 'auth-logs':
 *   - One partial batch:
 *     [
 *       `{ userId: 'alice', action: 'login' }`
 *     ]
 *
 * ### Design Decision: No Peeking (`extractAccumulatedBatches`)
 * To maintain integrity, the class **does not provide direct access** to accumulated
 * items or batches. Exposing internal references could allow unintended modifications,
 * such as appending items to a full batch.
 * Instead, the `extractAccumulatedBatches` method **transfers ownership** of all batches
 * to the caller while resetting the instance to a clean state. This ensures the component's
 * guarantees remain intact and prevents accidental modifications of extracted batches.
 * However, while direct peeking is not possible, users can utilize the getter methods
 * `totalAccumulatedItemsCount`, `activeKeysCount`, and `isEmpty` to assess whether extraction
 * is needed.
